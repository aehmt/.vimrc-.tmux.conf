# .vimrc-.tmux.conf
Current .vimrc and .tmux.conf setup I am using. Optimized for iTerm use.
.vimrc configuration is optimized for neovim. But I keep my setup compatible with Vim for the sake of redundancy.

At the moment Terminal.app doesn't support truecolors with current setup.

```
:set termguicolor
```

to bring back colors.
